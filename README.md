Motivation for the concept
For the concept we were really thinking towards a rhythmic Virtual Reality experience. After coming up with several concepts - we discussed that it should be a game in a techy/space world where you could dance to the music. Our concept is not based to score points, but to immerse in a different reality with different rules. The inspiration and rules in the digital world came from the movie TRON. Our goal for this project was to create an immersive rhythmic game in VR that won’t get you sick!

Technical difficulties 
Because our concept is based in VR and generates blocks on the beat; we needed a script that would act like a metronome. The metronome script is called ‘OnBeat’ and it gives flexibility on what musical section we instantiate different objects.

The blocks are spawned by a script that ‘randomizes’ its position. It hovers around the player. By doing so the position of the blocks that are generated on the beat come from multiple positions.

We added visual effects to the blocks that got hit; we had to tweak the amount of effect lower because the effect would make people noistn. 

Technical choices
Position of the blocks that are spawned are improved in the latest version. This will improve the excitement and replayability of the game as the blocks spawn in multiple places on ‘random’ positions. We changed the static wall into a fully immersive abyss. With moving blocks all around, this was important as it was ‘too boring’ when blocks were only spawning from one position.

VFX
Added particle effect on some blocks that will ‘explode’ so we have more variation of the outcome of different blocks. This came out of tests we did that people would play for only 2 minutes. 

Visuals
About the visual part, we choose a high color contrast between the blocks inspired by Tron and a Tokyo neon lights setting. The visual has the purpose to immerse the player into an artificial place and to captivate its attention while playing the game. The visual and the music works hand in hand to build an sci-fi atmosphere.

Music
We wanted to use techy sound for the game. We tried samples of Erick Kempnich - Zoar and other techno tracks. Finally we asked Fabian Hendrix (M&T) to create a track for us for this game based on the Erick Kempnich - Zoar example.

Bart
For the concept I was really thinking towards a rhythmic Virtual Reality experience. I discussed this with the team and after some brainstorming we ended up with a first concept about a rhythmic game in VR. I was responsible for the metronome script ‘on the beat’, a script that would change the background position (we tested this but it would make people nauseous).
I made voice clips of ‘the system’ and tested the game a whole lot. For the background music I had contact with my good friend Fabian Hendrix. I was the sound actor/designer for the voice lines of the system and I made sure the look & feel was right.
